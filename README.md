# STOCK-RECOMMENDATION-COMPREHENSIVE-ANALYSIS-FOR-INFORMED-INVESTING

A key component of investment decision-making is stock market advice, as investors look for trustworthy direction to increase their profits and reduce their risks. But correctly predicting stock market trends and spotting lucrative possibilities is a difficult endeavour that is strongly influenced by a wide range of variables and market dynamics. In this initiative, we want to tackle this problem by combining fundamental and technical analysis with the power of machine learning techniques. The dataset, which was generated using data from the Bombay Stock Exchange's official website, includes the fundamental data of Reliance Industries. Data for basic and technical analysis is acquired from reputable sources. The dataset's ten-year time period, which is separated into four quarters each year, offers a thorough historical assessment of the stock performance of the companies. The detailed investigation of market trends, patterns, and indicators made possible by this huge dataset improves the prediction ability of the created models. In this project, machine learning techniques like Random Forest, ANN, MLP and LSTM are being used. For regression tasks, Random Forest and ANN are used, whilst ANN and MLP are used for stacking (ensembling technique). Combining these algorithms enables a comprehensive strategy for stock market suggestion that takes into account both short- and long-term horizons. The models significantly outperform conventional methods in terms of prediction accuracy after thorough review and back testing. Fundamental and technical research are all combined to give investors a thorough grasp of the market and the ability to make wise judgements.
